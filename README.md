# Data-Skills-Tableau-
## Projects for data skills using tableau
### Project 1
This is the tableau dashboard that I created using the dataset that I have on the % of job change in the UK, this was done by transfering the dataset from excel into the tableau program and then I created three different sheets that linked the information on the dataset that would correlate best which was % change of sub-industry, the sum of percentage change based on the industry and the map of the location that have been most effected by this. This allowed me to be able to create the dashboard using all of this information to find a correlation between the different information and to then come to a conclusion that would support the inforamtion that I obtained.

### Project 2

This is another tableau dashboard that I created using a dataset that showed the information of what spotify music was being listened to. This was done by putting the dataset from excel into tableau and then created differnet visual aids like the graphs to determine what the correlation was between the dataset and the trends in the listening habits of the users on spotify. This was done by looking at the popularity, the tempo of the music and the duration of the music to see if there was a correlation between the different visual graphs and to come to a conclusion on the information that I obtained.
