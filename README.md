# Data Skills in Tableau
## Projects for data skills using tableau
### Project 1
This is the tableau dashboard that I created using the dataset that had information on the & job change in the United Kingdom which was supplied by Just IT. Once I imported the data into Tableau from excel I then went into my first sheet and creating a graph that used the sum of & change to the industry that this was in. I then created a second sheet and used that to calculate the change between the two tables that were in the dataset on the sum of change-change, I then used a sheet to create a map so that the data would show the geographical data of the areas that were most affected by these changes. The last step was to create a dashboard so that I could use all the data that had collected and so that I could show the correlation between the data and what I had find out.

My findings:
In my findings I found that the most affected locations in the country was the locations in the south such as London and Brighton and that the most affected industry's were remedaition activiites, mining support services and water collection, this would allow a business to be able to look at this information and then come up with the correct solutions to try and resolve this problem.


### Project 2

This is another tableau dashboard that I created using a dataset that was given to me by Just IT and showed the information of what spotify music was being listened to. This was done by putting the dataset from excel into tableau and then created different visual aids like the graphs to determine what the correlation was between the dataset and the trends in the listening habits of the users on spotify. This was done by looking at the popularity, the tempo of the music and the duration of the music to see if there was a correlation between the different visual graphs and to come to a conclusion on the information that I obtained.

My finding:

In my findings I found out that the most listened music was hip-hop and that there was a small correlation to the tempo and popularity, I was also able to see the duration of the different types of music and this meant that a business would then be able to see this information and then use it to be able to fine tune their music so that they would be able to retain their users since there is less people coming to listen to A Capella compared to something like Hip-Hop which gives them the most users.
